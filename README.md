> [!NOTE]
> I am no AHK coding genius. This is just a simple project I made to make coding life feel easier.

## About the project

> A simple AutoHotKey script intended to make programming and coding overall easier by adding shortcut keybinds.
An example could be to add i.e curly brackets but with only the push of 1 button. Or a combo of keys to perform one task. 

> By keybinding to whatever key you may want to use, you can save effort and press 1 button to do things you couldn't do without two arms.

> In my case I have keybinded curly brackets to "Ctrl + Left Alt" instead of taking my hand off my mouse to then press Alt Gr.

## How it can help / relieve
> This AHK script helps me writing codes faster and more efficient. It really makes things much faster and easier to utilize most of the left side of the keyboard.
> To avoid as much as possible movement between the keyboard and the mouse. The script is highly adjustable so just find some keybinds that works for you and keep coding!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Play around with it as much as you want. AHK can be used in so many areas for example keybinding keys to code faster or keybind your trigger button to reach practicly no-recoil in CS. Just teach the mouse movement they spray pattern of the weapon. Or just BHOP script as normal folks do.
